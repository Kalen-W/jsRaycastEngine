This is an attempt at creating a simple raycasting engine / game that draws directly onto a canvas.  

This project is based off the following tutorial: <https://youtu.be/5nSFArCgCXA>  
This tutorial's code can also be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/satansdeer/raycaster)

Additional features, such as wall texture rendering, figured out with the assistance of the additional following tutorials:
